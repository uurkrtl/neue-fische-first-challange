## Coding: Java Intro

Create your first program and execute it.

-   Step 1: Create a new class with the name 'HelloWorld'.
-   Step 2: Define the main method in your class.
-   Step 3: In the main method, print the text 'Hello, Java!' to the console.
-   Step 4: Save and run your program. Check if 'Hello, Java!' appears on the console.
-   Step 5: Change the text you print to the console to 'Java is cool!'
-   Step 6: Save and run your program again. Check if the modified text appears on the console.

Perform arithmetic operations and use variables in Java.

-   Step 1: Declare two variables 'a' and 'b' of type int and assign them any integer values.
-   Step 2: Add the values of 'a' and 'b' and store the result in a new variable 'sum'.
-   Step 3: Print the value of 'sum' to the console, along with the text 'Sum: '.

Perform arithmetic operations with different data types and use relational operators.

-   Step 1: Perform arithmetic operations with two 'int' values (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and print the results on the console.
-   Step 2: Compare 2 'int' values for: greater than, less than, equality, and print the results on the console.
-   Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2, but this time use 'float' and 'double' values.
