# Day-1: Java-Basic


## Coding: Java Intro

Create your first program and execute it.

-   Step 1: Create a new class with the name 'HelloWorld'.
-   Step 2: Define the main method in your class.
-   Step 3: In the main method, print the text 'Hello, Java!' to the console.
-   Step 4: Save and run your program. Check if 'Hello, Java!' appears on the console.
-   Step 5: Change the text you print to the console to 'Java is cool!'
-   Step 6: Save and run your program again. Check if the modified text appears on the console.

Perform arithmetic operations and use variables in Java.

-   Step 1: Declare two variables 'a' and 'b' of type int and assign them any integer values.
-   Step 2: Add the values of 'a' and 'b' and store the result in a new variable 'sum'.
-   Step 3: Print the value of 'sum' to the console, along with the text 'Sum: '.

Perform arithmetic operations with different data types and use relational operators.

-   Step 1: Perform arithmetic operations with two 'int' values (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and print the results on the console.
-   Step 2: Compare 2 'int' values for: greater than, less than, equality, and print the results on the console.
-   Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2, but this time use 'float' and 'double' values.



# Day-2: If-Else-Method


## [](https://github.com/neuefische/hh-java-24-1-handouts/blob/main/1-Java/03-If-Else-Method/challenges.md#coding-simple-calculation)Coding: Simple Calculation

Write a Java method that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the result of their addition.

-   Step 1: Write a method named 'add' that takes two int parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers.
-   Step 2: Call the method within your main() method and print the result to the console.

Check and understand your program. Then extend it.

-   Step 1: Debug your program: go through each line of your program step by step.
-   Step 2: Extend the 'add' method to also support floating-point numbers (double). (Research how a Java method can support different parameter/return types)
-   Step 3: Write another method named 'subtract' that takes two int parameters and returns the difference of the two numbers.
-   Step 4: Write another method named 'makePositive' that simply returns positive numbers and converts negative numbers to positive numbers. (For argument '5', '5' should be returned, but for argument '-28', '28' should be returned)
-   If you have already completed this task earlier, you may work on the bonus task on the next page.

Great, you have made good progress! Now, work on the bonus tasks.

-   Create a conditional statement to call the 'subtract' method if the first number is greater than the second, otherwise call the 'add' method.
-   Write a method that checks if a number is even. Even numbers should be returned as is, while odd numbers should be doubled.
-   Write a method that takes a string as a parameter and checks if it is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same forwards and backwards). Return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.
